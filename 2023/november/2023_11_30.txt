1. I am not good at parsing heard sentences. 

2. Accept everything that has happened, beauty and terror. 
Just keep going; no feeling is final. 

3. I have so much to learn even in a narrow field. 

4. The IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
The RAS is the Robotics and Automation Society of the IEEE. 

5. Adcom = Administrative Committee

6. Excom = Executive Committee

7. sautee = light frying

8. Z-X cam has depth sensing using stereo cameras. 
Some machine vision solutions take LIDAR and reconstruct a depth image, for better training results. 

9. FurnitureSim scripted assembly uses a finite state machine to keep track of the current skill that needs to be performed. 

10. Dynamic Motion Primitives are small mathematical modules that reproduce a specific trajectory shape dynamically, implemented with overlapping
Gaussian activation functions, taking in a canonical (hidden, core) system and outputting the forcing term to reproduce the trajectory. 
By changing certain parameters, the DMP module can carry out the essence of a trajectory across spatio-temporal scaling, and even obstacle avoidance. 

11. Operational Space Control (OSC) is FK IK + Dynamics + feedback control

12. POE is a method of powering and delivering signals to a device.
Ethernet is usually suited for 1 to 1 communication. 
Multiple devices require a switch.
